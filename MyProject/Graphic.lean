A monoid M is graphic if it satifies the graphical identity,
aba = ab
-/
class GraphicMonoid (M : Type) extends Monoid M where
  graphic_id : âˆ€ a b : M, a * b * a = a * b

/-
Since a Graphic Monoid is a Monoid,
then it satisfies the axioms of monoid.
Of course, all the theorems for monoids in Mathlib are aviable
for graphic monoids.
